        Space stations are complex, modular structures designed to support long-term human habitation and scientific research in space. They typically consist of multiple interconnected modules, each serving a specific function, such as living quarters, laboratories, docking ports, and solar power arrays. The core structure is reinforced to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including microgravity, radiation, and extreme temperature variations. Advanced life support systems regulate air, water, and temperature, ensuring a habitable environment for astronauts. Additionally, external robotic arms and communication systems facilitate maintenance, research operations, and connectivity with Earth and visiting spacecraft.

        Space stations offer numerous advantages, including serving as research hubs for scientific experiments that cannot be conducted on Earth. They facilitate advancements in medicine, materials science, and space technology while also preparing astronauts for future deep-space missions. Additionally, they foster international collaboration, bringing together scientists and engineers from around the world to push the boundaries of human knowledge. However, space stations also present significant challenges. Their construction and maintenance require substantial financial investment, and astronauts face risks such as radiation exposure, microgravity-related health issues, and potential technical failures. Despite these challenges, space stations remain essential for the future of space exploration and human expansion beyond Earth.

        Dangers
        
        </h2>
        
        <p style="font-family: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif;
        font-size: 17px;
        color: white;
        text-align: left;">
        
        Space stations operate in a harsh and unforgiving environment, exposing astronauts to several dangers. One of the primary risks is prolonged exposure to space radiation, which can increase the likelihood of cancer and other health issues. Microgravity also poses challenges, leading to muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and changes in cardiovascular function over time. Additionally, space stations rely on complex life support systems, and any technical failure—such as air leaks, power outages, or equipment malfunctions—could pose serious threats to crew safety. The risk of collisions with space debris or micrometeoroids is another concern, as even small particles traveling at high speeds can cause significant damage. Despite these dangers, rigorous safety protocols, advanced technology, and continuous monitoring help mitigate risks and ensure astronaut well-being.

    <h1>Planets</h1>
    <p>
      Planets are dynamic celestial bodies that shape our understanding of the universe. From the rocky landscapes of Mars to the swirling storms of Jupiter, each planet holds unique characteristics that reveal the secrets of cosmic evolution.
      <br><br>
      Within our solar system, eight planets orbit the Sun, while beyond, thousands of exoplanets continue to expand our knowledge of space and the possibility of life beyond Earth. Through scientific discoveries and exploration, we uncover the mysteries of these fascinating worlds.
      <br><br>
      Join us as we journey through the wonders of planets and their role in the vast cosmos.

    <h2>Their Properties</h2>
    <p>
      Planets come in a diverse range of sizes, compositions, and atmospheres, each with distinct properties that define their nature. Some, like Earth and Mars, are rocky terrestrial planets with solid surfaces, while others, like Jupiter and Saturn, are massive gas giants with turbulent atmospheres and powerful storms.
      <br><br>
      Key planetary characteristics include mass, gravity, temperature, and atmospheric composition, all of which influence a planet’s ability to support life. Some planets have magnetic fields that shield them from cosmic radiation, while others have extreme environments with scorching heat or freezing temperatures. The presence of moons, rings, and geological activity further adds to the complexity of these celestial bodies.
      <br><br>
      By studying planetary properties, scientists gain valuable insights into how planets form, evolve, and interact with their surroundings.
    </p>

    <h2>Physical Properties</h2>
    <p>
      The physical properties of planets, such as their mass, gravity, and the number of moons, are key to understanding their behavior and role within their star systems. Planets vary significantly in size and weight, with gas giants like Jupiter being the largest, weighing over 300 times as much as Earth, and terrestrial planets like Mercury being much smaller in mass and volume.
      <br><br>
      The gravitational pull of a planet is directly related to its mass and size. Larger planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, have much stronger gravity compared to Earth, which influences everything from their atmospheric conditions to the orbits of their moons. In contrast, smaller planets like Mars and Mercury exert weaker gravity, affecting their ability to retain atmospheres and support potential life.
      <br><br>
      In our solar system, planets are accompanied by numerous moons. Jupiter and Saturn are the leaders, each with over 70 moons orbiting them, while Earth has just one, and Mercury and Venus have none. These moons can range from small, irregularly shaped bodies to large, spherical moons like Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.
    </p>

    <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
    <p>
      The chemical makeup of planets plays a crucial role in shaping their environments, surfaces, and atmospheres. Planets are primarily composed of a variety of elements and compounds that determine their structure, appearance, and even potential for supporting life.
      <br><br>
      Terrestrial planets like Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury are made up mostly of silicate rock and metals, with Earth having a rich diversity of chemical elements that support life. These planets have solid surfaces and metallic cores, which contribute to their magnetic fields and internal heat. The chemical composition of their atmospheres also varies, with Earth’s being primarily nitrogen and oxygen, while Venus and Mars have atmospheres dominated by carbon dioxide, creating vastly different climates.
      <br><br>
      Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of methane, ammonia, and other compounds. These gases form dense atmospheres and contribute to their signature cloud patterns and extreme weather systems.
      <br><br>
      The outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are often called ice giants due to their higher concentrations of water, ammonia, and methane ice. These compounds influence their pale blue appearance and extreme cold environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Planet Earth</h2>
    <p>
      Earth is a remarkable planet, unique in our solar system for its ability to support a rich diversity of life. As the third planet from the Sun, Earth’s position in the habitable zone allows it to maintain the conditions necessary for liquid water, a critical ingredient for life.
      <br><br>
      One of the most distinctive features of Earth is its atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. This composition not only sustains life but also creates a protective shield that filters harmful radiation from the Sun and helps regulate the planet's temperature.
      <br><br>
      Earth’s surface is dynamic, with continents, oceans, mountains, and valleys continuously reshaped by the forces of plate tectonics. Earth’s magnetic field, generated by its liquid iron core, also plays a vital role in protecting the planet from solar winds and cosmic radiation.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Planets are more than just distant, glowing spheres in the sky; they are dynamic worlds filled with complexity and wonder. Each planet, from the smallest rocky world to the massive gas giants, offers unique insights into the forces that shape our universe. As we continue to study their properties, atmospheres, and chemical compositions, we deepen our understanding of the cosmos and the processes that govern planetary formation and evolution.
      <br><br>
      Planet Earth remains a testament to the delicate balance of natural systems that make life possible, serving as both a beacon of hope and a model for exploring the potential for life beyond our solar system.
